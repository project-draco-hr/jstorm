def rebalance(*args):
    'Syntax: [jstorm rebalance topology-name [-w wait-time-secs]]\n\n    Sometimes you may wish to spread out where the workers for a topology \n    are running. For example, let\'s say you have a 10 node cluster running \n    4 workers per node, and then let\'s say you add another 10 nodes to \n    the cluster. You may wish to have Storm spread out the workers for the \n    running topology so that each node runs 2 workers. One way to do this \n    is to kill the topology and resubmit it, but Storm provides a "rebalance" \n    command that provides an easier way to do this.\n\n    Rebalance will first deactivate the topology for the duration of the \n    message timeout (overridable with the -w flag) and then redistribute \n    the workers evenly around the cluster. The topology will then return to \n    its previous state of activation (so a deactivated topology will still \n    be deactivated and an activated topology will go back to being activated).\n    '
